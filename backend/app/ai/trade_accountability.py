"""
Trade Accountability — evaluate trade quality by process, not just P&L.

Classification matrix:
- Skilled Win: correct reasoning + profit → reinforce
- Correct Process: correct reasoning + loss → don't adjust (just variance)
- Lucky Win: wrong reasoning + profit → DON'T reinforce (noise)
- Real Mistake: wrong reasoning + loss → learn and adjust

Expert traders learn from process, not from results.
