"""
Expert Decision Framework — encodes expert trader decision process.

Core principle: Default = don't trade. Must PROVE it's worth trading.

Expert checklist:
1. Market condition tradeable? → if not → sit out
2. Clear setup exists? → if not → sit out
3. Risk/reward acceptable? → if not → sit out
4. Enough confirmations? → if not → sit out
5. All checks pass → trade with appropriate size

4 out of 5 outcomes = "sit out" — experts trade less, but more accurately.
